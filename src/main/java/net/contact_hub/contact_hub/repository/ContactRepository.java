/*
 * A Repository in Spring Boot is a central mechanism that encapsulates the logic required 
 * to access data sources. It abstracts the data access layer, allowing you to 
 * interact with databases in a cleaner and more maintainable way. Repositories 
 * are part of the Spring Data JPA framework, which simplifies 
 * data access using JPA (Java Persistence API).
 * 
 * CRUD Operations: 
 * Spring Data JPA repositories come with built-in methods 
 * for common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, 
 * such as save(), findById(), findAll(), and delete().
