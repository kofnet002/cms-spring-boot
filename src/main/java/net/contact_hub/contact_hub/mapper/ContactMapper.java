/*
 * The purpose of this class is to convert (or "map") 
 * between two different types of objects: Contact (the entity/model) 
 * and ContactDto (the Data Transfer Object). 
 * This mapping process helps to keep different layers of the
 *  application separate and allows you to control what data is 
 * exposed to other parts of your application.
 * 
 * Contact: main data model, which represents a contact stored in the database. 
 * It probably has more fields and is directly linked to the database.
 * 
 * ContactDto: This is a simplified version of Contact. It’s a Data Transfer 
 * Object that usually contains only the necessary data you want to send back to clients 
 * (e.g., when using a REST API).
